		abstract:
			"MRI acquisition is slow because it requires dense sampling of k-space, the frequency-domain representation of the scan. Lacunae artificially undersamples k-space at 4x acceleration - retaining only 25% of frequency lines - and trains a U-Net to reconstruct diagnostically useful images from the incomplete data. A naive inverse FFT on undersampled k-space produces severe aliasing artifacts; the model learns to recover the missing structure. Trained on the fastMRI single-coil knee dataset with L1 loss and evaluated on SSIM and PSNR.",

		abstract:
			"Commodities are upstream inputs to the businesses that consume them. This project investigates whether commodity momentum statistically precedes sector equity momentum, quantifies the lag structure across 1–5 trading days, and tests whether that predictive precedence is exploitable as a long/short trading signal. Granger causality tests, VAR estimation, and a DAG-based causal graph are applied across five commodity–equity pairs including WTI→XLE, Copper→XLB, and Gold→GDX.",
